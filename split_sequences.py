This script is only relevant for the two bigger, imbalanced datasets
These datasets contain all frames (in Graph form) of counter attacking sequences - not only the events.

To avoid leaking information between test and train set we randomly split along the sequence ids ('id').
This means that all frames of one sequence will either be in the test set, or in the train set and never in both.
